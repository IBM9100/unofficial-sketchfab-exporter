# The Unofficial Sketchfab Exporter add-on for Blender 2.8

This is exactly the same as the official version except that it now works in Blender 2.8. And since Sketchfab, as of this writing, can't handle Blender 2.8 .blend files, the add-on converts the .blend file to an .fbx in the background and uploads that instead. After installing the add-on it can be found by pressing the 'n' key in objectmode.

## Other Changes

1. Updated the Sketchfab API that was used from v1 to v3.
2. Added a choice for adding a category for you model
3. Added the option to publish or just export as a draft
4. Added the choice to make your model inspectable
5. Added the choice to make your model downloadable on sketchfab
6. Added a choice for choosing a license if you make your model downloadable

## Disclaimer

I'm not the author to the official Sketchfab exporter add-on. I did this project mostly to teach myself how to create add-ons for Blender. It's possible that there are still some bugs in the code, since I found it quite challenging to convert from 2.7. Hopefully it can still be useful to you until such a time Sketchfab updates their official add-on.
